# Tacotron2_in_keras

This is an implementation of Tacotron-2 architecture in Keras. 
It's based on the implementation (in tensorflow) of this repository : 
https://github.com/Rayhane-mamah/Tacotron-2
The implementation is not not done yet : 
- Attention mechanism (LocationSensitiveAttention) : Done (i think ! if anyone can confirm my implementation)
- ZoneoutLSTM : Done (i think)
- Different blocks of Tacotron model : nearly done
- training / prediction : not done (i will do this soon)
- Wavenet : i can't do this part it seems too difficult with Keras now
